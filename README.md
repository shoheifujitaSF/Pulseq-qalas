# Rapid, open-source, cross-platform 3D multiparametric mapping for multisite neuroimaging

This is the official code for **"Vendor-agnostic 3D multiparametric relaxometry improves cross-platform reproducibility"**.
The related abstract has been presented at [International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) Annual Meeting 2024](https://www.ismrm.org/24m/).
Reconstruction and fitting code are shared. 

An open-source implementation across different vendors and scanners, along with a consistent reconstruction and fitting pipeline, improved measurement reproducibility. This approach facilitates data harmonization, version control and error-propagation assessment, making it also suitable for extracting quantitative information for downstream analysis.

This code requires [Pulseq](https://github.com/pulseq). [TOPPE](https://toppemri.github.io/) is used for running on GE scanners.
